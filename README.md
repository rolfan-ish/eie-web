## About this 
`blog.html` was hand made.

`posts.json` was hand made, is used in `blog.html` and lists the contents of `posts/`. Since it is a JSON file it does not contain comments.

The contents of `posts/` are markdown and handmade.

Anything that isn't listed here as hand made was from a template, or are just assets, like the contents of `images/`.
